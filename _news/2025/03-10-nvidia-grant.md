We are thrilled to announce that our project, **SafetyGPT: Domain-Specific Multi-Modal LLM for Transport Safety and Management**, has been selected for inclusion in the NVIDIA Academic Grant Program!

NVIDIA has generously awarded the University of Wisconsin-Madison with **20,000 A100 GPU-Hours on Saturn Cloud**, valued at **$25,800 USD**. This grant will significantly accelerate our research in developing specialized large language models for transportation safety applications.

We extend our sincere gratitude to NVIDIA for their support and look forward to sharing the research outcomes this grant will help us achieve!
