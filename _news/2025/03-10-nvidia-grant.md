We are thrilled to announce that two of our projects have been selected for inclusion in the NVIDIA Academic Grant Program!

NVIDIA has generously awarded the University of Wisconsin-Madison with:
1. **20,000 A100 GPU-Hours on Saturn Cloud** (valued at $25,800 USD) for our project **SafetyGPT: Domain-Specific Multi-Modal LLM for Transport Safety and Management**
2. **Two RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell GPUs** (valued at $18,000 USD) for our project **EdgeTwin: An Edge AI-Enabled Digital Twin for Intelligent Traffic Management**

These grants, with a combined value of **$43,800 USD**, will significantly accelerate our research in developing specialized AI models for transportation safety applications and intelligent traffic management systems.

We extend our sincere gratitude to NVIDIA for their generous support and look forward to sharing the research outcomes these grants will help us achieve!
