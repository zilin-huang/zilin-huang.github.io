I participated in the Transportation Research Board (TRB) 103nd Annual Meeting (January 7-11) at the Washington, D.C. Convention Center. We presented our work in multiple poster and lectern sessions, engaging with transportation professionals from around the world for feedback and future collaboration opportunities. Cheers!
