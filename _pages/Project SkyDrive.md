SkyDrive is a multi-agent human-in-the-loop, digital-twin-enabled traffic simulator that integrates CARLA, VR, Websocket, and ROS to create a versatile and formidable research platform. This synergistic integration crafts highly realistic and dynamic settings, enabling comprehensive studies of human behavior, vehicle dynamics, and the intricacies of connected transportation systems. 

A particularly notable aspect of SkyDrive is its innovative multi-agent and human-in-the-loop capabilities, which allows the incorporation of numerous human participants as interactive agents within the simulation environment. This allows for the simulation of complex interactions among a variety of intelligent agents, such as autonomous vehicles (AVs), human-driven vehicles (HVs), and pedestrians. Such functionality offers deep insights into the nuanced interplay of human actions within traffic ecosystems.
